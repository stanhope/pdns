1.0.0-alpha2
------------

Released February 5th 2016

Changes since 1.0.0-alpha1:

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Lua functions now receive a DNSQuestion ``dq`` object instead of
   several parameters. This adds a greater compatibility with PowerDNS
   and allows adding more parameters without breaking the API
   (`#3198 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/3198>`__)
-  Added a ``source`` option to ``newServer()`` to specify the local
   address or interface used to contact a downstream server
   (`#3138 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/3138>`__)
-  CNAME and IPv6-only support have been added to spoofed responses
   (`#3064 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/3064>`__)
-  ``grepq()`` can be used to search for slow queries, along with
   ``topSlow()``
-  New Lua functions: ``addDomainCNAMESpoof()``, ``AllowAction()`` by
   @bearggg, ``exceedQRate()``, ``MacAddrAction()``, ``makeRule()``,
   ``NotRule()``, ``OrRule()``, ``QClassRule()``, ``RCodeAction()``,
   ``SpoofCNAMEAction()``, ``SuffixMatchNodeRule()``, ``TCPRule()``,
   ``topSlow()``
-  ``NetmaskGroup`` support have been added in Lua
   (`#3144 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/3144>`__)
-  Added ``MacAddrAction()`` to add the source MAC address to the
   forwarded query
   (`#3313 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/3313>`__)

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

-  An issue in DelayPipe could make dnsdist crash at startup
-  ``downstream-timeouts`` metric was not always updated
-  ``truncateTC`` was unproperly updating the response length
   (`#3126 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/3126>`__)
-  DNSCrypt responses larger than queries were unproperly truncated
-  An issue prevented info message from being displayed in non-verbose
   mode, fixed by Jan Broer
-  Reinstating an expired Dynamic Rule was not correctly logged
   (`#3323 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/3323>`__)
-  Initialized counters in the TCP client thread might have cause FD and
   memory leak, reported by Martin Pels
   (`#3300 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/3300>`__)
-  We now drop queries containing no question (qdcount == 0)
   (`#3290 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/3290>`__)
-  Outstanding TCP queries count was not always correct
   (`#3288 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/3288>`__)
-  A locking issue in exceedRespGen() might have caused crashs
   (`#3277 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/3277>`__)
-  Useless sockets were created in client mode
   (`#3257 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/3257>`__)
-  ``addAnyTCRule()`` was generating TC=1 responses even over TCP
   (`#3251 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/3251>`__)

Web interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Cleanup of the HTML by Sander Hoentjen
-  Fixed an XSS reported by @janeczku
   (`#3217 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/3217>`__)
-  Removed remote images
-  Set the charset to UTF-8, added some security-related and CORS HTTP
   headers
-  Added server latency by Jan Broer
   (`#3201 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/3201>`__)
-  Switched to official minified versions of JS scripts, by Sander
   Hoentjen (`#3317 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/3317>`__)
-  Don't log unauthenticated HTTP request as an authentication failure
