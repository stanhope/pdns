Managing DNSSEC Trust Anchors in the Lua Configuration
======================================================
The DNSSEC Trust Anchors and Negative Trust Anchors must be stored in the Lua Configuration file.
See the :doc:`../dnssec` for all information about DNSSEC in the PowerDNS Recursor.
This page only documents the Lua functions for DNSSEC configuration

  :param str dsrecord: The DS Record content associated with ``name``

.. function:: addNTA(name[, reason])

  Please read :ref:`ntas` for operational information on NTAs.

  :param str name: The name in the DNS tree from where this NTA should be used
